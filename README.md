### The Mint Boutique 

Online Shopping Website


# This is a full-stack web app following full RESTful routing and giving the user access to full CRUD functionality.
You're able to browse through all pages depending on what category you are shopping for. As a user, you are able to add items to your cart, delete them from your cart, view your cart, and create an order with the items in your cart.

## NEXT STEPS: 
I would like to add functionality of stripe or another payment option like paypal so that this website will be fully functional. I would also like to add the ability to search and add more categories per department. I would like to create a myaccount page where the user can update their information, see all orders, and change password.  I may even look into an API.
